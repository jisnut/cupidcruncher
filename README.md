Administration and participant software for The "No" Workshop.

The app/admin administrative directory contains files for the "No" Workshop leaders to manage questions, configurations and participant responses and control the generation of their match reports.

The app/participant directory contains the web app for "No" Workshop participants. It's currently just an AngularJS web app, but will soon develop a phonegap/cordova wrapper project.

The app/data directory contains files to bootstrap a MongoDB instance. They will be utilized upon first initialization of the admin page.
